tacky-borders lets you customize the borders on Windows 11 (and maybe 10?).

**Installation:**
Just download, unzip it, and run the .exe!

**Configuration options:**
The config.yaml is located at %USERPROFILE%/.config/tacky-borders/config.yaml. The easiest way to get to it is to open the system tray menu, right click tacky-borders, and hit "Open Config"

Currently, the following options are customizable:
- border_size: Thickness of the borders
- border_offset: How close the borders are to the window edges
- border_radius: Leave it at -1 to let tacky-borders handle the radius adjstments, or set it to any other value to use as the radius.
- active_color: Color of the active window. Currently, you can use "accent" to grab the Windows accent color, or use your own hex code like "#ffffff"
- inactive_color: Color of the inactive window. Currently, you can use "accent" to grab the Windows accent color, or use your own hex code like "#ffffff"
